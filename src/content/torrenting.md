# Torrenting

Torrenting is the use of peer to peer connections where computers publicly upload and download chunks of files between each other. This allows for a
decentralised system of sharing files that can't be taken down as easily as uploading to a single storage service like Google Cloud. But it has the issue
of requiring many devices constantly uploading files (seeding) to keep the torrents alive, which means niche or old content can be hard to download.
